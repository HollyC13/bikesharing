A review of the length of time each bike is checked out shows a significant majority of "trips" are < 20 minutes long, with trips for males trending slightly longer than those for other gender categories.

####  Bike Usage by Hour/Day

This visualization illustrates the number of bike trips by day for each hour of the day, by gender.  Number of trips is higher for males relative to other gender groups.

####  Bike Usage by Day/Gender/Customer Type

![Usage](/Resources/Story_5.png)
This graphic illustrates the number of bike trips by day, gender and user type (customer vs. annual subscriber).  Number of trips is higher for annual subscribers than for "one-time" customers.

## Summary
Analysis of the August 2019 Manhattan, New York City data shows a majority of CitiBike users are male.  Trip data indicates users are committed to biking as a means of transportation to and from work, as shown by the number of weekday trips around the start and end of a "standard" workday and by the number of users who have purchased Annual Subscriptions, at least during a month with relatively bike-friendly weather.

#### Recommendations
* Analysis/visualization of trip data for months in which bike riding could be challenging due to weather conditions to establish year-round program feasibility.
* Analysis/visualization of potential user density in Des Moines, IA to establish appropriate population and placement of program resources.
